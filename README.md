# Olympia-Oyster-Gene-Expression
R code for gene expression analyses performed in Olympia oysters (Maynard et al., 2018)
#this repository contains R code used for the analyses of gene expression described in Maynard et al. (2018)Transcriptomic responses to extreme low salinity among locally adapted populations of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) 
#analysis used the DeSeq2 package in R
#requires matrix of raw counts and a bioconidtions file as specified by DESeq2
#includes two-factor generalized linear models wiht interaction terms
#also includes code for performing principal components analysis
